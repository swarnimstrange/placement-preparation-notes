<h1>Difference Between In and Exists<h1>

# In

-> IN can be used as a replacement for multiple OR operators.
-> In the IN-condition SQL Engine compares all the values in the IN Clause.
-> A direct set of values can be given for comparison.
-> To check against only a single column, IN operator can be used.

# Exists

-> To determine if any values are returned or not, we use EXISTS.
-> Once true is evaluated in the EXISTS condition then the SQL Engine will stop the process of further matching.
-> Cannot compare directly the values, sub-query needs to be given.
-> For checking against more than one single column, you can use the EXISTS Operator.
