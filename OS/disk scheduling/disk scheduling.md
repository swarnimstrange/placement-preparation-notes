<h3> Disk Scheduling </h3>

- Disk scheduling â€“: try to improve access time and bandwidth.

- requests of tracks are given and to schedule those request properly, we use disk scheduling.

- we want to lessen the seek time and want to cover as many tracks in less time.

- FCFS (FIRST COME FIRST SERVE) 

- SSTF (SHORTEST SEEK TIME FIRST)

- SCAN (Elevator algorithm) -> it goes to the last possible range and then comes back.

- LOOK -> it goest to last request and then comes back.
