<h3> pre-emptive </h3>

-> the type of scheduling algorithm where processes can be changed in between from one process to another process.

-> types of pre-emptive algorithms:
- Round-robin -: uses time quantum to execute the tasks one by one 
- Shortest remaining job first. (SRTF) checks after every one unit of time if there's some shortest job available in queue or not. 
- Longest remaining job first. (LRTF)
- Priority based -: CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority 

<h3> non-preemptive </h3>

-> this is the type of algorithm where processes cannot be changedin between from ready-state to running state.

-> the type of non-preemptive algorithms are:
- First come first serve (FCFS) -: as the name suggest the process that got in first will be executed first and so on.
- SJF (Shortest Job first) -: the shortest job will be executed first and so on.
- LJF (Longest Job first) -: the longest job will be executed first and so on.
- Multilevel Queue -: have different priority level ready queues
