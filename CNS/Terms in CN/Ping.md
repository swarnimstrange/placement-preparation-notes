<h3> Ping </h3>

- A ping (Packet Internet or Inter-Network Groper) is a basic Internet program that allows a user to test and verify if a particular destination IP address exists and can accept requests in computer network administration.
- Ping is also used diagnostically to ensure that a host computer the user is trying to reach is operating.
