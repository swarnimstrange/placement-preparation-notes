<h3> STP Cable </h3>

- A shielded twisted pair is a type of twisted pair cable that contains an extra wrapping foil or copper braid jacket to protect the cable from defects like cuts, losing bandwidth, noise, and signal to the interference.
- It is a cable that is usually used underground, and therefore it is costly than UTP.
- It supports the higher data transmission rates across the long distance.
- Advantages -:
  - It has lower noise and attenuation than UTP.
  - It is shielded with a plastic cover that protects the STP cable from a harsh environment and increases the data transmission rate.
- Disadvantages -:
  - It is the most expensive wire from UTP cables.
  - It requires more maintenance to reduce the loss of data signals.
