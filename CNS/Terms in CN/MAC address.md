<h3> MAC address </h3>

- MAC address is the physical address, which uniquely identifies each device on a given network. 
- To make communication between two networked devices, we need two addresses: IP address and MAC address.
- It stands for Media Access Control, and also known as Physical address or hardware address
- It is globally unique; it means two devices cannot have the same MAC address. It is represented in a hexadecimal format on each device
- It is 12-digit, and 48 bits long, out of which the first 24 bits are used for OUI (Organization Unique Identifier), and 24 bits are for NIC/vendor-specific (Network Interface Card).
- It works on the data link layer of the OSI model.
