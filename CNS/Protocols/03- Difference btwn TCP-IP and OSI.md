<pre>
        TCP/IP                                          |             OSI
                                                        |
    -> has 4 layers                                     |   -> has 7 layers
    -> is more reliable                                 |   -> is less reliable
    -> session, application and                         |   -> different layers
       presentation layers are one                      |
                                                |
    -> TCP/IP developed protocols then model.           |    -> OSI developed model then protocol.
