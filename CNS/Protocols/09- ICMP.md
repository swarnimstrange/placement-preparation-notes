<h3> ICMP </h3>

- It stands for Internet Control Message Protocol
- Since IP does not have an inbuilt mechanism for sending error and control messages. It depends on ICMP to provide an error control.
- It is used for reporting errors and management queries. It is a supporting protocol and is used by networks devices like routers for sending error messages and operations information.
- e.g. the requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.
