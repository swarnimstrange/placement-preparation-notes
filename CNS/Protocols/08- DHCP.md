<h3> DHCP </h3>

- It stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
- DHCP is based on a client-server model and based on discovery, offer, request, and ACK.
- It is a network management protocol used on IP networks. A DHCP server is used to assign an IP address and other configurations to the connected devices on the network to communicate with others.
- When the DHCP server is absent, the IP address for a computer or other device needs to be manually assigned. But, later, these devices can not be connected outside the local subnet.
