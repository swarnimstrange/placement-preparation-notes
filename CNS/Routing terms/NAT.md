<h3> NAT </h3>

- NAT stands for Network Address Translation.
- The idea of NAT is to allow multiple devices to access the Internet through a single public address.
- Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.
- several advantages of NAT are-:
    - NAT conserves legally registered IP addresses.
    - It provides privacy as the deviceâ€™s IP address, sending and receiving the traffic, will be hidden. 
    - Eliminates address renumbering when a network evolves.
