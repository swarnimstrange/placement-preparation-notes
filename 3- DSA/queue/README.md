<h3> Queue </h3>

-> As a stack, the queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner.

-> for example customers standing in a queue to pay for their purchase.

<h3> Priority Queue </h3>

-> Priority Queues are abstract data structures where each data/value in the queue has a certain priority.

-> or example, In airlines, baggage with the title “Business” or “First-class” arrives earlier than the rest. 

-> Priority Queue is an extension of the queue with the following properties.
    <li> An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority. </li>
    <li> If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue. </li>
