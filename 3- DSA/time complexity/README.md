<h3> Time Complexity </h3>

-> the time complexity is how long a program takes to process a given input

-> In case of data structure and algorithms it is defined as the number of times a particular instruction set is executed.

-> It is because the total time took also depends on some external factors like the compiler used, processorâ€™s speed.

-> most of the time we calculate input size based on the number of itms in the input. for example, sorting n integers in an array we have n data elements, so input size = n. 

-> similar example, searching in a linked list of n nodes, traversing a tree of n nodes.
