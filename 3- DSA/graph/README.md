<h3> Graphs </h3>

-> A graph is a nonlinear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
-> The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph

-> More formally a Graph can be defined as a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

-> By using graphs we can easily find the shortest path, neighbors of the nodes, and many more.

-> Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex.

-> the most commonly used representations of a graph.
