<h3> Tuples </h3>

-> Tuples are similar to lists but they are immutable in nature. It cannot be modified.

-> In Python, tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping of the data sequence. 

-> To create a tuple of one element there must be a trailing comma. For example, (8,) will create a tuple containing 8 as the element.

-> tuples are faster than lists because they are stored in a single block of memory. Tuples are immutable so, It doesn't require extra space to store new objects.
