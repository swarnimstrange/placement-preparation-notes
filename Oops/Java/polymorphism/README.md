<h3> Polymorphism </h3>

-> Polymorphism is made from two words "poly" and "morphism" where poly means many and morphism means forms. When we perform a task in several different ways then we call polymorphism.

<h3> Types of Polymorphism </h3>

- There are two types of polymorphism

 - Compiletime polymorphism.
 - Runtime Polymorphism.

<h3> CompileTime Polymorphism </h3>

- The polymorphism which is implemented at the compile time is known as compile-time polymorphism. Example - Method Overloading 

- we call it compile-time polymorphism bcoz it detects at compile time if we have implemented it well and gives error at compile-time.

 <b> Method Overloading <b> is a technique which allows you to have more than one function with the same function name but with different functionality. Method overloading can be possible on the following basis: 

- The type of the parameters passed to the function. 
 - for example String for first function, Int for second etc. 

- The number of parameters passed to the function.
 - for example first is just String, second is both String and Int etc.

- Different return type
 - for example frst function return type is string so secod return type should be int etc.
