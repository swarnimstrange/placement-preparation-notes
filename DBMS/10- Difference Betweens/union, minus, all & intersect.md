<h1>Difference Between Union, Union all, Minus and Intersect<h1>

# Union

-> UNION is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements.
-> However it will eliminate duplicate rows from its result set.
-> data type must be same in both the tables

# Union all

-> same as union but it shows all records including duplicates.

# Minus

-> The MINUS set operator will return results of two SELECT statements that are found in the first query specified that donâ€™t exist in the second query.

# Intersect

-> Intersect operation is used to combine two SELECT statements, it retuns common records from both SELECT statements.
-> number of columns and datatype must be same
