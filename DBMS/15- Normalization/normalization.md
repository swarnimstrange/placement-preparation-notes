<h3> Normalization </h3>

-> It is the processes of reducing the redundancy of data in the table and also improving the data integrity.

-> without Normalization in SQL, we may face many issues such as

<b> Insertion anomaly: </b> It occurs when we cannot insert data to the table without the presence of another attribute.

<b> Update anomaly: </b>  It is a data inconsistency that results from data redundancy and a partial update of data.

<b> Deletion Anomaly: </b> It occurs when certain attributes are lost because of the deletion of other attributes.
