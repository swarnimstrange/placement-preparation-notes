<h3> Binary Heap </h3>

-> A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree


-> Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

<ul>
<li>
Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
</li>
<li>
Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
</li>
</ul>
