<h3> Transmission mode </h3>

- Transmission mode means transferring data between two devices. It is also known as a communication mode.
- Buses and networks are designed to allow communication to occur between individual devices that are interconnected.

- There are three types of transmission mode -:
  - Simplex Mode –:
    - In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.
    - Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.
    - The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction.
  - Half-Duplex Mode –:
    - In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.
    - When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.
  - Full-Duplex Mode -:
    - both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.
    - In full_duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction
    - this sharing can occur in two ways:
      - Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths, one for sending and the other for receiving.
      - Or the capacity is divided between signals traveling in both directions.
