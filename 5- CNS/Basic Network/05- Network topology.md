<h3> Network Topology </h3>

- Network Topology refers to the physical layout of the computer network.
- It basically gives the design in which the computers are connected to each other.
- there are several topologies like "bus topology", "ring topology", "star topology", "tree topology", etc.
- Wireless Links are wireless access points, routers etc.

<h4> Note: <h4>
-> In bus topology all devices share a common communication line.
-> In star topology all devices are connected to the central hub device
-> In ring topology each node connects other two nodes
-> In mesh topology nodes are connected to one or more nodes
-> Tree topology is also called hierarachial topology, it is similar to star topology and it inherits bus topology
-> Point to Point is a network that connects exactly two devices.
-> In hybrid chain nodes are connected in more than one topology styles.
