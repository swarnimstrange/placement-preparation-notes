<h3> NOS </h3>

- A network operating system(NOS) is software that connects multiple devices and computers on the network and allows them to share resources on the network
- Functions of the NOS -:
    - Creating and managing user accounts on the network.
    - Controlling access to resources on the network.
    - Provide communication services between the devices on the network.

<h3> Types of NOS </h3>

- Peer to Peer –:
    - Peer-to-peer network operating systems allow sharing resources and files with small-sized networks and having fewer resources.
    - In general, peer-to-peer network operating systems are used on LAN.

- Client/server –:
    - Client-server network operating systems provide users access to resources through the central server.
    - This NOS is too expensive to implement and maintain.
    - This operating system is good for the big networks which provide many services.
