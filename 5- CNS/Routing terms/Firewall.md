<h3> Firewall </h3>

- A firewall can be defined as a special type of network security device or a software program that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a defined set of security rules.
- It acts as a barrier between internal private networks and external sources (such as the public Internet).
- The primary purpose of a firewall is to allow non-threatening traffic and prevent malicious or unwanted data traffic for protecting the computer from viruses and attacks.
