<h3> DNS </h3>

- DNS stands for The Domain Name System 
- DNS is like the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com.
- Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
- DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
