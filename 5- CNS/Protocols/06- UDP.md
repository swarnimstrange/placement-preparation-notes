<h3> UDP </h3>

- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol wherein error-checking and recovery services are not required.
- With UDP, there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection.
- data is continuously sent to the recipient, whether or not they receive it. 
- it is largely preferred for real-time communications like broadcast or multitask network transmission
