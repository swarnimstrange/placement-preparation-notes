<h3> Subnet Mask </h3>

- Suppose we have a Class A network that means we have 16 million hosts in a network. The task we have to do is:
    - Maintenance of such a huge network
    - Security for the network

- For this we need subnetting i.e., dividing a huge network into smaller network.
- A subnet mask is a 32-bit number which is used to identify the subnet of an IP address. 
- The subnet mask is combination of 1’s and 0’s. 1’s represents network and subnet ID while 0’s represents the host ID.
