<h3> Object Oriented Programming </h3>

- Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, Encapsulation.

- The word object-oriented is the combination of two words i.e. object and oriented. The dictionary meaning of the object is an article or entity that exists in the real world. The meaning of oriented is interested in a particular kind of thing or entity.

<h3>  Classes </h3>

- Class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical and contains some attributes and methods.

- The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated.

- For example, Car is a class. The name and color of a car are its properties, and the actions performed by the car are known as functions like driving. 

<h3> Objects </h3>

- Object is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item. An object can operate on both data members (String or Integer etc.) and member functions (object functions).

- An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity. The example of an logical entity is the banking system.

<h3> This Keyword </h3>

- ‘this’ keyword in Java that refers to the current instance of the class. 
- In OOPS it is used to: 
    *pass the current object as a parameter to another method 
    *refer to the current class instance variable

<h3> Note </h3>

- When an object is created using a new keyword, then space is allocated for the variable in a heap, and the starting address is stored in the stack memory.
