<h3> Non-Parameterized constructor </h3>

- A constructor which has no argument is known as non-parameterized constructor(or no-argument constructor). It is invoked at the time of creating an object. If we donâ€™t create one then it is created by default by Java.

<h3> Parameterized constructor </h3>

- Constructor which has parameters is called a parameterized constructor. It is used to provide different values to distinct objects. 

<h3> Copy Constructor </h3>

- A Copy constructor is an overloaded constructor used to declare and initialize an object from another object. 
- There is only a user defined copy constructor in Java (C++ has a default one too).
- Whenever we need to make object's copy then we can do it using copy constructor.
