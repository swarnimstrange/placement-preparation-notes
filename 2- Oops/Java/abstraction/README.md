<h3> Abstraction </h3>

- We try to obtain an abstract view, model or structure of a real life problem, and reduce its unnecessary details. With definition of properties of problems, including the data which are affected and the operations which are identified, the model abstracted from problems can be a standard solution to this type of problems. It is an efficient way since there are nebulous real-life problems that have similar properties. 

- In simple terms, it is hiding the unnecessary details & showing only the essential parts/functionalities to the user.

- For example, Suppose we are going to buy a car for ourselves. So, it's but obvious that we we will look at informations like Model, Price, Milage etc. but what we don't want to know is that how engines turbines will work or how the engine is taking petrol in use to move the car these types of details we dont prefer while buying a car. So what abstraction will do is that it will hide unneccesary details and will only show what's relevant to us.

<h3> How Abstraction is achieved ? </h3>

- <b> Abstraction is achieved in 2 ways -: </b>
  - Abstract class
  - Interfaces (Pure Abstraction)

<h3> Abstract Class </h3>
<ul>
<li>An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.</li>
<li> It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.</li>
<li> It cannot be instantiated. </li>
<li> It can have constructors and static methods also. </li>
<li> It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.</li>
</ul>
